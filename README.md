it is a student regs. form made by html , css and js
it got function like editing the text deleting the text 

problem's faced duering makeing the project

.there were very less material for the local and session storage 

suggestions;-
.There should be class in which the module prjects are explained because class's we have those teacher don't have any idea regarding the module project 
if you can organize a class in every module were you just explain how the project should be made what all we can do in it .. it will be helpful.

thankyou,
